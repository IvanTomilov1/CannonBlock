# CannonBlock
Simple realization of a simple experiment with cannonball and deflecting plane controlled by an algorithm.

Task:
  There are 2d-plane and the experiment on it.
  In this experiment there are cannon that shoots red circle with a radius R. Start speed is random. Direction is fixed, but for every shoot there are some fluctuation in angle.
  On the right side there are plane P with side lenght L = 2R. This plane can move only up and down. 
  
  Required:
    1) Graphical realization of an experiment
    2) There must be gravitation on the scene to make ball fly by ballistic trajectory.
    3) Implement control algorihm for a plane that has only middle side of a plane (that is between grey lines) as an input. Task: cannonball must be deflected by plane and not pass by
    4) You must not use information about initial conditions of cannonball's motion.
